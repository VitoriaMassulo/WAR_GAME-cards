I NOTICED AFTER SHARING HOMEWORKS

THAT MOST WHERE USING WHILE LOOP
FOR THE FIRST EXERCISE I DID 2 VERSIONS 

ONE THAT STOPS ONLY WHEN ONE REACHES TEN POINTS
AND THE OTHER USING THE FOR CODE

I NOTICED THAT SINCE THE CODE ITS FOR _ IN RANGE 10 TO GENERATE
IT ALWAYS STOPS AT SHUFFLE 10


HOPE YOU CAN CHECK THAT, I NOTICED AS WELL THAT IGNORING THIS IN THE SECOND EXERCISE I HAD TO REPEAT THE CODE GENERATION LINE TWICE FOR THE PLAYERS.. GOT LAZY AND DIDNT MAKE THE WHILE LOOP VESION T0 BE MORE “DRY”
